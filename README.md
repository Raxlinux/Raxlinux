## Hey!👋 Nice to meet you. I'm Rashad. 🛡️

🚀 About Me

I have always been fascinated by the "language" of technology—how computers and the internet communicate across the globe. Though my academic journey began in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, my curiosity for the digital world never faded.

⚡ The Transition

For over 3 years, I worked in the manufacturing industry, specifically in Siemens Control and Relay Panel testing. While I excelled in the physical side of technology, my goal was always the digital frontier: Cybersecurity.

Because I believe that in a world driven by rapid technological advancement, security is not just a feature—it is a fundamental human necessity.

🎓 Education & Evolution

To bridge the gap between my professional experience and my passion, I enrolled in the BITS Pilani WILP program, graduating in 2025 with a B.Tech in Engineering and Technology. This degree provided the academic foundation I needed to finally pivot toward my true calling.

🛡️ Current Mission: 365 Days of Security

I am currently executing a rigorous 1-year specialized training plan—a curriculum I designed by blending AI-driven insights with current industry trends.

This repository is more than just code; it is my journey. It serves as my living portfolio, documenting every lab, every commit, and every breakthrough. My goal is simple: to build a body of work so robust that it speaks for itself.
